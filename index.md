CARRIER is a research project whose objective is to make the best use of available data for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.


The consortium behind the CARRIER project consists of clinicians, data scientists, health service researchers and legal experts who are working together to develop a data-driven, participative, self-care intervention. 


CARRIER will combine clinical data from different sources (hospitals and general practitioners) with socio-economic data from CBS to build a prediction models that will identify citizens at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. We propose to invite these citizens to a personalised lifestyle intervention informed by data-driven insights. Citizen and clinicians will agree on a personalised health plan taking into account personal preferences and effectiveness. Finally, the long-term adherence to the personalised health plan will the support of an eCoach.
