Your privacy is important for the CARRIER project. That is why we put all the necessary measures in place to reduce the risk of. Your personal data may be processed in the CARRIER project for a specific purpose. 

## **What is the purpose of data processing within the CARRIER project?**

The purpose of the data processing in the CARRIER project is the development and validation of cardiovascular risk prediction models. These models are, in essence, a formula that estimates a person's risk to develop  cardiovascular disease given a set of characteristics (e.g. age, gender, comorbidities, family history).

## **How are we going to process citizens' data?**

Researchers will only have access to pseudonymised data that cannot be traced back to individual citizens. These data will then be used to train a number of models, whose performance we will assess by comparing it against part of the data. We will make sure that it is not possible to reproduce individual level data from the models.

## **How do we protect the data?**

We use IT security measures to protect for unwanted access or corruption of the data. All involved parties (UM, CBS, MUMC+ and Zuyderland) have standard operating procedures in place to guarantee a high level of security. The IT infrastructure set up for CARRIER will be tested with a penetration test before data is placed in it.

On top of that, we use privacy preserving techniques (secret sharing, homomorphic encryption and synthetic data) to prevent each institution's data being revealed to other parties within the project.

## **Maintenance and destruction of data**

We store the data in secure IT servers throughout the duration of the project and four years after the publication of the results of our study, for reproducibility purposes.
